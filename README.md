## About Project

We were tasked with building a library using object oriented javascript, html, and css. Naturally,
we decided to take this idea and make it absolutely more complicated than necessisary because it's fun.

We wanted to create a digital book shelf that books would be added to, you could click on, and then see the finer details
submited through our form. We also wanted new shelves to be created when a shelf was full of books. This lead to alot of interesting
problems we needed to figure out, and perhaps a few we're still working on.
